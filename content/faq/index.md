## General

### What is the JSON Schema Conference?

The JSON Schema Conference is a technical conference organized by the JSON Schema Community.
It is aimed for the community to share and exchange experiences between existing users and new members. Throughout the day, renowned speakers will present a variety of topics including innovations, use cases, live coding sessions, tooling presentations, case studies as well as best practices.

The JSON Schema Conference is part of [API Days Paris](https://www.apidays.global/paris/), the leading series of worldwide conferences on the Programmable Economy. We would like to thank them to hosting us and making this conference possible.

## Sponsor / Partner?

### How to become a sponsor/partner?

We are looking for a Sponsor to help us cover the expenses of travel and accomodation as well as support speakers with a speaker stipend to make it easier for them to come.

This is an amazing opportunity to support the Community. To know more about how to sponsor please check [the conference's page in our Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/json-schema/events/the-json-schema-conference-f259215b).


## CFP: Call for Paper

The CFP is the official CFP of API Days Paris available [here](https://apidays.typeform.com/to/ILJeAaV8?typeform-source=www.apidays.global#event_name=xxxxx). Please make sure you select The JSON Schema Conference in the event's list.

Last but not least, selected speakers can opt-in for a 500$ travel stipend. This won't cover all the expenses but we hope to make everything much easier for them.
